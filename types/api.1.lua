---                 • "editor" The global editor grid
---                 • "win" Window given by the `win` field, or current
---                   window.
---                 • "cursor" Cursor position in current window.
---                 • "mouse" Mouse position
---
---               • win: |window-ID| for relative="win".
---               • anchor: Decides which corner of the float to place at
---                 (row,col):
---                 • "NW" northwest (default)
---                 • "NE" northeast
---                 • "SW" southwest
---                 • "SE" southeast
---
---               • width: Window width (in character cells). Minimum of 1.
---               • height: Window height (in character cells). Minimum of 1.
---               • bufpos: Places float relative to buffer text (only when
---                 relative="win"). Takes a tuple of zero-indexed [line,
---                 column]. `row` and `col` if given are applied relative to this position, else they
---                 default to:
---                 • `row=1` and `col=0` if `anchor` is "NW" or "NE"
---                 • `row=0` and `col=0` if `anchor` is "SW" or "SE" (thus
---                   like a tooltip near the buffer text).
---
---               • row: Row position in units of "screen cell height", may be
---                 fractional.
---               • col: Column position in units of "screen cell width", may
---                 be fractional.
---               • focusable: Enable focus by user actions (wincmds, mouse
---                 events). Defaults to true. Non-focusable windows can be
---                 entered by |nvim_set_current_win()|.
---               • external: GUI should display the window as an external
---                 top-level window. Currently accepts no other positioning
---                 configuration together with this.
---               • zindex: Stacking order. floats with higher `zindex` go on top on floats with lower indices. Must be larger
---                 than zero. The following screen elements have hard-coded
---                 z-indices:
---                 • 100: insert completion popupmenu
---                 • 200: message scrollback
---                 • 250: cmdline completion popupmenu (when
---                   wildoptions+=pum) The default value for floats are 50.
---                   In general, values below 100 are recommended, unless
---                   there is a good reason to overshadow builtin elements.
---
---               • style: (optional) Configure the appearance of the window.
---                 Currently only supports one value:
---                 • "minimal" Nvim will display the window with many UI
---                   options disabled. This is useful when displaying a
---                   temporary float where the text should not be edited.
---                   Disables 'number', 'relativenumber', 'cursorline',
---                   'cursorcolumn', 'foldcolumn', 'spell' and 'list'
---                   options. 'signcolumn' is changed to `auto` and
---                   'colorcolumn' is cleared. 'statuscolumn' is changed to
---                   empty. The end-of-buffer region is hidden by setting
---                   `eob` flag of 'fillchars' to a space char, and clearing
---                   the |hl-EndOfBuffer| region in 'winhighlight'.
---
---               • border: Style of (optional) window border. This can either
---                 be a string or an array. The string values are
---                 • "none": No border (default).
---                 • "single": A single line box.
---                 • "double": A double line box.
---                 • "rounded": Like "single", but with rounded corners ("╭"
---                   etc.).
---                 • "solid": Adds padding by a single whitespace cell.
---                 • "shadow": A drop shadow effect by blending with the
---                   background.
---                 • If it is an array, it should have a length of eight or
---                   any divisor of eight. The array will specifify the eight
---                   chars building up the border in a clockwise fashion
---                   starting with the top-left corner. As an example, the
---                   double box style could be specified as [ "╔", "═" ,"╗",
---                   "║", "╝", "═", "╚", "║" ]. If the number of chars are
---                   less than eight, they will be repeated. Thus an ASCII
---                   border could be specified as [ "/", "-", "\\", "|" ], or
---                   all chars the same as [ "x" ]. An empty string can be
---                   used to turn off a specific border, for instance, [ "",
---                   "", "", ">", "", "", "", "<" ] will only make vertical
---                   borders but not horizontal ones. By default,
---                   `FloatBorder` highlight is used, which links to
---                   `WinSeparator` when not defined. It could also be
---                   specified by character: [ ["+", "MyCorner"], ["x",
---                   "MyBorder"] ].
---
---               • title: Title (optional) in window border, string or list.
---                 List should consist of `[text, highlight]` tuples. If
---                 string, the default highlight group is `FloatTitle`.
---               • title_pos: Title position. Must be set with `title`
---                 option. Value can be one of "left", "center", or "right".
---                 Default is `"left"`.
---               • footer: Footer (optional) in window border, string or
---                 list. List should consist of `[text, highlight]` tuples.
---                 If string, the default highlight group is `FloatFooter`.
---               • footer_pos: Footer position. Must be set with `footer`
---                 option. Value can be one of "left", "center", or "right".
---                 Default is `"left"`.
---               • noautocmd: If true then no buffer-related autocommand
---                 events such as |BufEnter|, |BufLeave| or |BufWinEnter| may
---                 fire from calling this function.
