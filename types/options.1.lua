-- 							*shada-!*
-- 	!	When included, save and restore global variables that start
-- 		with an uppercase letter, and don't contain a lowercase
-- 		letter.  Thus "KEEPTHIS and "K_L_M" are stored, but "KeepThis"
-- 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
-- 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
-- 							*shada-quote*
-- 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
-- 		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
-- 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
-- 		start of a comment!
-- 							*shada-%*
-- 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
-- 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
-- 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
-- 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
-- 		('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
-- 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
-- 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
-- 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
-- 		buffers are stored.
-- 							*shada-'*
-- 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
-- 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
-- 		'shada' is non-empty.
-- 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
-- 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
-- 							*shada-/*
-- 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
-- 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
-- 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
-- 		'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-:*
-- 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-<*
-- 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
-- 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
-- 		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
-- 		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in KiB.
-- 							*shada-@*
-- 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-c*
-- 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
-- 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and 'encoding' value is fixed
-- 		to UTF-8 as well.
-- 							*shada-f*
-- 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
-- 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
-- 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
-- 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
-- 							*shada-h*
-- 	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the shada
-- 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
-- 		has been used since the last search command.
-- 							*shada-n*
-- 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
-- 		the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
-- 		'shadafile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
-- 		given here with 'shada'.  Environment variables are
-- 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
-- 							*shada-r*
-- 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
-- 		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
-- 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
-- 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
-- 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
-- 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
-- 							*shada-s*
-- 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
-- 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
-- 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
-- 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
-- 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
-- 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because

-- 	'fileencoding' is set to it.  If all fail, 'fileencoding' is set to
-- 	an empty string, which means that UTF-8 is used.
-- 		WARNING: Conversion can cause loss of information! You can use
-- 		the |++bad| argument to specify what is done with characters
-- 		that can't be converted.
-- 	For an empty file or a file with only ASCII characters most encodings
-- 	will work and the first entry of 'fileencodings' will be used (except
-- 	"ucs-bom", which requires the BOM to be present).  If you prefer
-- 	another encoding use an BufReadPost autocommand event to test if your
-- 	preferred encoding is to be used.  Example: >
-- 		au BufReadPost * if search('\S', 'w') == 0 |
-- 			\ set fenc=iso-2022-jp | endif
-- <	This sets 'fileencoding' to "iso-2022-jp" if the file does not contain
-- 	non-blank characters.
-- 	When the |++enc| argument is used then the value of 'fileencodings' is
-- 	not used.
-- 	Note that 'fileencodings' is not used for a new file, the global value
-- 	of 'fileencoding' is used instead.  You can set it with: >
-- 		:setglobal fenc=iso-8859-2
-- <	This means that a non-existing file may get a different encoding than
-- 	an empty file.
-- 	The special value "ucs-bom" can be used to check for a Unicode BOM
-- 	(Byte Order Mark) at the start of the file.  It must not be preceded
-- 	by "utf-8" or another Unicode encoding for this to work properly.
-- 	An entry for an 8-bit encoding (e.g., "latin1") should be the last,
-- 	because Vim cannot detect an error, thus the encoding is always
-- 	accepted.
-- 	The special value "default" can be used for the encoding from the
-- 	environment.  It is useful when your environment uses a non-latin1
-- 	encoding, such as Russian.
-- 	When a file contains an illegal UTF-8 byte sequence it won't be
-- 	recognized as "utf-8".  You can use the |8g8| command to find the
-- 	illegal byte sequence.

-- 	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as

-- 	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
-- 	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
-- 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for Windows) means to
-- 	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
-- 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
-- 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
-- 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
-- 	  with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs. This will
-- 	  ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
-- 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a

-- <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start

-- 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing

-- 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
-- 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
-- 	choice than "/tmp".  But it can contain a lot of files, your swap
-- 	files get lost in the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your
