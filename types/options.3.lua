-- 	  directory listed in the option does not exist, it is created.
-- 	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
-- 	  impossible!) and no |E303| error will be given.
-- 	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
-- 	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
-- 	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
-- 	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
-- 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for Windows) means to
-- 	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
-- 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
-- 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
-- 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
-- 	  with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs. This will
-- 	  ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
-- 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
-- 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
-- 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
-- 	  use '//', instead of '\\'.
-- 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
-- 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
-- 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
-- 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
-- 	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
-- 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
-- 	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
-- <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
-- 	  of the option is removed.
-- 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
-- 	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
-- 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
-- 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
-- 	choice than "/tmp".  But it can contain a lot of files, your swap
-- 	files get lost in the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your
-- 	home directory is tried first.
-- 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing

-- 		and "_K_L_M" are not.  Nested List and Dict items may not be
-- 		read back correctly, you end up with an empty item.
-- 							*shada-quote*
-- 	"	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  Old name of
-- 		the '<' item, with the disadvantage that you need to put a
-- 		backslash before the ", otherwise it will be recognized as the
-- 		start of a comment!
-- 							*shada-%*
-- 	%	When included, save and restore the buffer list.  If Vim is
-- 		started with a file name argument, the buffer list is not
-- 		restored.  If Vim is started without a file name argument, the
-- 		buffer list is restored from the shada file.  Quickfix
-- 		('buftype'), unlisted ('buflisted'), unnamed and buffers on
-- 		removable media (|shada-r|) are not saved.
-- 		When followed by a number, the number specifies the maximum
-- 		number of buffers that are stored.  Without a number all
-- 		buffers are stored.
-- 							*shada-'*
-- 	'	Maximum number of previously edited files for which the marks
-- 		are remembered.  This parameter must always be included when
-- 		'shada' is non-empty.
-- 		Including this item also means that the |jumplist| and the
-- 		|changelist| are stored in the shada file.
-- 							*shada-/*
-- 	/	Maximum number of items in the search pattern history to be
-- 		saved.  If non-zero, then the previous search and substitute
-- 		patterns are also saved.  When not included, the value of
-- 		'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-:*
-- 	:	Maximum number of items in the command-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-<*
-- 	<	Maximum number of lines saved for each register.  If zero then
-- 		registers are not saved.  When not included, all lines are
-- 		saved.  '"' is the old name for this item.
-- 		Also see the 's' item below: limit specified in KiB.
-- 							*shada-@*
-- 	@	Maximum number of items in the input-line history to be
-- 		saved.  When not included, the value of 'history' is used.
-- 							*shada-c*
-- 	c	Dummy option, kept for compatibility reasons.  Has no actual
-- 		effect: ShaDa always uses UTF-8 and 'encoding' value is fixed
-- 		to UTF-8 as well.
-- 							*shada-f*
-- 	f	Whether file marks need to be stored.  If zero, file marks ('0
-- 		to '9, 'A to 'Z) are not stored.  When not present or when
-- 		non-zero, they are all stored.  '0 is used for the current
-- 		cursor position (when exiting or when doing |:wshada|).
-- 							*shada-h*
-- 	h	Disable the effect of 'hlsearch' when loading the shada
-- 		file.  When not included, it depends on whether ":nohlsearch"
-- 		has been used since the last search command.
-- 							*shada-n*
-- 	n	Name of the shada file.  The name must immediately follow
-- 		the 'n'.  Must be at the end of the option!  If the
-- 		'shadafile' option is set, that file name overrides the one
-- 		given here with 'shada'.  Environment variables are
-- 		expanded when opening the file, not when setting the option.
-- 							*shada-r*
-- 	r	Removable media.  The argument is a string (up to the next
-- 		',').  This parameter can be given several times.  Each
-- 		specifies the start of a path for which no marks will be
-- 		stored.  This is to avoid removable media.  For Windows you
-- 		could use "ra:,rb:".  You can also use it for temp files,
-- 		e.g., for Unix: "r/tmp".  Case is ignored.
-- 							*shada-s*
-- 	s	Maximum size of an item contents in KiB.  If zero then nothing
-- 		is saved.  Unlike Vim this applies to all items, except for
-- 		the buffer list and header.  Full item size is off by three
-- 		unsigned integers: with `s10` maximum item size may be 1 byte
-- 		(type: 7-bit integer) + 9 bytes (timestamp: up to 64-bit
-- 		integer) + 3 bytes (item size: up to 16-bit integer because
-- 		2^8 < 10240 < 2^16) + 10240 bytes (requested maximum item
-- 		contents size) = 10253 bytes.

vim.o.showcmd = "true"
-- string	(default "inclusive")
-- 			global
-- 	This option defines the behavior of the selection.  It is only used
-- 	in Visual and Select mode.
-- 	Possible values:
-- 	   value	past line     inclusive ~
-- 	   old		   no		yes
-- 	   inclusive	   yes		yes
-- 	   exclusive	   yes		no
-- 	"past line" means that the cursor is allowed to be positioned one
-- 	character past the line.
-- 	"inclusive" means that the last character of the selection is included
-- 	in an operation.  For example, when "x" is used to delete the
-- 	selection.
-- 	When "old" is used and 'virtualedit' allows the cursor to move past
-- 	the end of line the line break still isn't included.
-- 	Note that when "exclusive" is used and selecting from the end
-- 	backwards, you cannot include the last character of a line, when
-- 	starting in Normal mode and 'virtualedit' empty.
vim.o.selection = "inclusive"
-- boolean (default on)
-- 			global
-- 	This option and 'timeoutlen' determine the behavior when part of a
-- 	mapped key sequence has been received. For example, if <c-f> is
-- 	pressed and 'timeout' is set, Nvim will wait 'timeoutlen' milliseconds
-- 	for any key that can follow <c-f> in a mapping.
vim.o.timeout = "true"
-- number	(default 1000)
-- 			global
-- 	Maximum number of times a mapping is done without resulting in a
-- 	character to be used.  This normally catches endless mappings, like
-- 	":map x y" with ":map y x".  It still does not catch ":map g wg",
-- 	because the 'w' is used before the next mapping is done.  See also
-- 	|key-mapping|.
vim.o.maxmapdepth = "1000"
-- string	(default "make")
-- 			global or local to buffer |global-local|
-- 	Program to use for the ":make" command.  See |:make_makeprg|.
-- 	This option may contain '%' and '#' characters (see  |:_%| and |:_#|),
-- 	which are expanded to the current and alternate file name.  Use |::S|
-- 	to escape file names in case they contain special characters.
-- 	Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.  See |option-backslash|
-- 	about including spaces and backslashes.
-- 	Note that a '|' must be escaped twice: once for ":set" and once for
-- 	the interpretation of a command.  When you use a filter called
-- 	"myfilter" do it like this: >
-- 	    :set makeprg=gmake\ \\\|\ myfilter
-- <	The placeholder "$*" can be given (even multiple times) to specify
-- 	where the arguments will be included, for example: >
-- 	    :set makeprg=latex\ \\\\nonstopmode\ \\\\input\\{$*}
-- <	This option cannot be set from a |modeline| or in the |sandbox|, for
-- 	security reasons.
