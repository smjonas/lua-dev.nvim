-- 	   extend	Right mouse button extends a selection.  This works

-- 	   popup	Right mouse button pops up a menu.  The shifted left
-- 			mouse button extends a selection.  This works like
-- 			with Microsoft Windows.
-- 	   popup_setpos Like "popup", but the cursor will be moved to the

-- 	Any attempts to set a different value will be rejected, and an error

-- 	For the Win32 GUI and console versions 'termencoding' is not used,

-- 	   "def", '"abc def"' runs shell named "abc def" with no additional
-- 	   arguments (here and below: additional means “additional to
-- 	   'shellcmdflag'”).
-- 	2. Quotes in option may be present in any position and any number:
-- 	   '"abc"', '"a"bc', 'a"b"c', 'ab"c"' and '"a"b"c"' are all equivalent
-- 	   to just "abc".
-- 	3. Inside quotes backslash preceding backslash means one backslash.
-- 	   Backslash preceding quote means one quote. Backslash preceding
-- 	   anything else means backslash and next character literally:
-- 	   '"a\\b"' is the same as "a\b", '"a\\"b"' runs shell named literally
-- 	   'a"b', '"a\b"' is the same as "a\b" again.
-- 	4. Outside of quotes backslash always means itself, it cannot be used
-- 	   to escape quote: 'a\"b"' is the same as "a\b".
-- 	Note that such processing is done after |:set| did its own round of
-- 	unescaping, so to keep yourself sane use |:let-&| like shown above.

-- 	- Empty means that no swap file will be used (recovery is
-- 	  impossible!) and no |E303| error will be given.
-- 	- A directory "." means to put the swap file in the same directory as
-- 	  the edited file.  On Unix, a dot is prepended to the file name, so
-- 	  it doesn't show in a directory listing.  On MS-Windows the "hidden"
-- 	  attribute is set and a dot prepended if possible.
-- 	- A directory starting with "./" (or ".\" for Windows) means to
-- 	  put the swap file relative to where the edited file is.  The leading
-- 	  "." is replaced with the path name of the edited file.
-- 	- For Unix and Win32, if a directory ends in two path separators "//",
-- 	  the swap file name will be built from the complete path to the file
-- 	  with all path separators substituted to percent '%' signs. This will
-- 	  ensure file name uniqueness in the preserve directory.
-- 	  On Win32, it is also possible to end with "\\".  However, When a
-- 	  separating comma is following, you must use "//", since "\\" will
-- 	  include the comma in the file name. Therefore it is recommended to
-- 	  use '//', instead of '\\'.
-- 	- Spaces after the comma are ignored, other spaces are considered part
-- 	  of the directory name.  To have a space at the start of a directory
-- 	  name, precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- To include a comma in a directory name precede it with a backslash.
-- 	- A directory name may end in an ':' or '/'.
-- 	- Environment variables are expanded |:set_env|.
-- 	- Careful with '\' characters, type one before a space, type two to
-- 	  get one in the option (see |option-backslash|), for example: >
-- 	    :set dir=c:\\tmp,\ dir\\,with\\,commas,\\\ dir\ with\ spaces
-- <	- For backwards compatibility with Vim version 3.0 a '>' at the start
-- 	  of the option is removed.
-- 	Using "." first in the list is recommended.  This means that editing
-- 	the same file twice will result in a warning.  Using "/tmp" on Unix is
-- 	discouraged: When the system crashes you lose the swap file.
-- 	"/var/tmp" is often not cleared when rebooting, thus is a better
-- 	choice than "/tmp".  But it can contain a lot of files, your swap
-- 	files get lost in the crowd.  That is why a "tmp" directory in your
-- 	home directory is tried first.
-- 	The use of |:set+=| and |:set-=| is preferred when adding or removing
-- 	directories from the list.  This avoids problems when a future version
-- 	uses another default.

-- 	Note that setting or resetting this option has no effect for some

-- 	Running into the limit often means that the pattern is very
-- 	inefficient or too complex.  This may already happen with the pattern
-- 	"\(.\)*" on a very long line.  ".*" works much better.
-- 	Might also happen on redraw, when syntax rules try to match a complex
-- 	text structure.
-- 	Vim may run out of memory before hitting the 'maxmempattern' limit, in
-- 	which case you get an "Out of memory" error instead.

-- 	Flag passed to the shell to execute "!" and ":!" commands; e.g.,
-- 	`bash.exe -c ls` or `cmd.exe /s /c "dir"`.  For Windows
-- 	systems, the default is set according to the value of 'shell', to
-- 	reduce the need to set this option by the user.
-- 	On Unix it can have more than one flag.  Each white space separated
-- 	part is passed as an argument to the shell command.
-- 	See |option-backslash| about including spaces and backslashes.
-- 	See |shell-unquoting| which talks about separating this option into

-- 	- When this option is set to "slash", a forward slash is used for path
-- 	  completion in insert mode. This is useful when editing HTML tag, or
-- 	  Makefile with 'noshellslash' on Windows.
-- 	- When this option is set to "backslash", backslash is used. This is
-- 	  useful when editing a batch file with 'shellslash' set on Windows.
-- 	- When this option is empty, same character is used as for
-- 	  'shellslash'.
-- 	For Insert mode completion the buffer-local value is used.  For
-- 	command line completion the global value is used.
