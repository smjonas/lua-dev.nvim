-- 		  "expr"     1 for an expression mapping (|:map-<expr>|).
-- 		  "buffer"   1 for a buffer local mapping (|:map-local|).
-- 		  "mode"     Modes for which the mapping is defined. In

-- 			     characters will be used:
-- 			     " "     Normal, Visual and Operator-pending
-- 			     "!"     Insert and Commandline mode
-- 				     (|mapmode-ic|)
-- 		  "sid"	     The script local ID, used for <sid> mappings

-- 		- A list with one number, e.g., [23]. The whole line with this
-- 		  number will be highlighted.
-- 		- A list with two numbers, e.g., [23, 11]. The first number is
-- 		  the line number, the second one is the column number (first
-- 		  column is 1, the value must correspond to the byte index as
-- 		  |col()| would return).  The character at this position will
-- 		  be highlighted.
-- 		- A list with three numbers, e.g., [23, 11, 3]. As above, but
-- 		  the third number gives the length of the highlight in bytes.

-- 		position, the returned Number will be the column at the end of
-- 		the <Tab>.  For example, for a <Tab> in column 1, with 'ts'
-- 		set to 8, it returns 8. |conceal| is ignored.
-- 		For the byte position use |col()|.
-- 		For the use of {expr} see |col()|.
-- 		When 'virtualedit' is used {expr} can be [lnum, col, off], where
-- 		"off" is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.  When "off" is omitted zero is used.
-- 		When Virtual editing is active in the current mode, a position
-- 		beyond the end of the line can be returned. |'virtualedit'|
-- 		The accepted positions are:
-- 		    .	    the cursor position
-- 		    $	    the end of the cursor line (the result is the
-- 			    number of displayed characters in the cursor line
-- 			    plus one)
-- 		    'x	    position of mark x (if the mark is not set, 0 is
-- 			    returned)
-- 		    v       In Visual mode: the start of the Visual area (the
-- 			    cursor is the end).  When not in Visual mode
-- 			    returns the cursor position.  Differs from |'<| in
-- 			    that it's updated right away.
-- 		Note that only marks in the current file can be used.
-- 		Examples: >
--   virtcol(".")	   with text "foo^Lbar", with cursor on the "^L", returns 5
--   virtcol("$")	   with text "foo^Lbar", returns 9
--   virtcol("'t")    with text "	  there", with 't at 'h', returns 6
-- <		The first column is 1.  0 is returned for an error.

-- 		all lines: >
-- 		    echo max(map(range(1, line('$')), "virtcol([v:val, '$'])"))

-- 		{list} must be a |List| with four or five numbers:
-- 		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off]
-- 		    [bufnum, lnum, col, off, curswant]
--
-- 		"bufnum" is the buffer number.	Zero can be used for the
-- 		current buffer.  When setting an uppercase mark "bufnum" is
-- 		used for the mark position.  For other marks it specifies the
-- 		buffer to set the mark in.  You can use the |bufnr()| function
-- 		to turn a file name into a buffer number.
-- 		For setting the cursor and the ' mark "bufnum" is ignored,
-- 		since these are associated with a window, not a buffer.
-- 		Does not change the jumplist.
--
-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
-- 		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.
--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.
--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
-- 		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the
-- 		cursor vertically.  When the "curswant" number is missing the
-- 		preferred column is not set.  When it is present and setting a
-- 		mark position it is not used.
--
-- 		Note that for '< and '> changing the line number may result in
-- 		the marks to be effectively be swapped, so that '< is always
-- 		before '>.
--
-- 		Returns 0 when the position could be set, -1 otherwise.
-- 		An error message is given if {expr} is invalid.
--
-- 		Also see |getpos()| and |getcurpos()|.
--
-- 		This does not restore the preferred column for moving
-- 		vertically; if you set the cursor position with this, |j| and
-- 		|k| motions will jump to previous columns!  Use |cursor()| to
-- 		also set the preferred column.  Also see the "curswant" key in

-- Deletes a match with ID {id} previously defined by |matchadd()|

-- Return the position and size of popup {id}.  Returns a Dict
-- 		with these entries:
-- 		    col		screen column of the popup, one-based
-- 		    line	screen line of the popup, one-based
-- 		    width	width of the whole popup in screen cells
-- 		    height	height of the whole popup in screen cells
-- 		    core_col	screen column of the text box
-- 		    core_line	screen line of the text box
-- 		    core_width	width of the text box in screen cells
-- 		    core_height	height of the text box in screen cells
-- 		    firstline	line of the buffer at top (1 unless scrolled)
-- 				(not the value of the "firstline" property)
-- 		    lastline	line of the buffer at the bottom (updated when
-- 				the popup is redrawn)
-- 		    scrollbar	non-zero if a scrollbar is displayed
-- 		    visible	one if the popup is displayed, zero if hidden
-- 		Note that these are the actual screen positions.  They differ
-- 		from the values in `popup_getoptions()` for the sizing and
-- 		positioning mechanism applied.
--
-- 		The "core_" values exclude the padding and border.
--
-- 		If popup window {id} is not found an empty Dict is returned.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetPopup()->popup_getpos()
function vim.fn.popup_getpos(id) end

-- Selects the {nr} match item, as set with a |:match|,
-- 		|:2match| or |:3match| command.
-- 		Return a |List| with two elements:
-- 			The name of the highlight group used
-- 			The pattern used.
-- 		When {nr} is not 1, 2 or 3 returns an empty |List|.
-- 		When there is no match item set returns ['', ''].
-- 		This is useful to save and restore a |:match|.
-- 		Highlighting matches using the |:match| commands are limited
-- 		to three matches. |matchadd()| does not have this limitation.
function vim.fn.matcharg(nr) end

-- Return the tangent of {expr}, measured in radians, as a |Float|
-- 		in the range [-inf, inf].
-- 		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			:echo tan(10)
-- <			0.648361 >
-- 			:echo tan(-4.01)
-- <			-1.181502
function vim.fn.tan(expr) end

-- Clears all matches previously defined for the current window
-- 		by |matchadd()| and the |:match| commands.
function vim.fn.clearmatches() end

-- Set the register {regname} to {value}.
-- 		{value} may be any value returned by |getreg()|, including
-- 		a |List|.
-- 		If {options} contains "a" or {regname} is upper case,
-- 		then the value is appended.
-- 		{options} can also contain a register type specification:
-- 		    "c" or "v"	      |charwise| mode
-- 		    "l" or "V"	      |linewise| mode
-- 		    "b" or "<CTRL-V>" |blockwise-visual| mode
-- 		If a number immediately follows "b" or "<CTRL-V>" then this is
-- 		used as the width of the selection - if it is not specified
-- 		then the width of the block is set to the number of characters
-- 		in the longest line (counting a <Tab> as 1 character).
-- 		If {options} contains "u" or '"', then the unnamed register is
-- 		set to point to register {regname}.
--
-- 		If {options} contains no register settings, then the default
-- 		is to use character mode unless {value} ends in a <NL> for
-- 		string {value} and linewise mode for list {value}. Blockwise
-- 		mode is never selected automatically.
-- 		Returns zero for success, non-zero for failure.
--
-- 							*E883*
-- 		Note: you may not use |List| containing more than one item to
-- 		      set search and expression registers. Lists containing no
-- 		      items act like empty strings.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			:call setreg(v:register, @*)
-- 			:call setreg('*', @%, 'ac')
-- 			:call setreg('a', "1\n2\n3", 'b5')
--
-- <		This example shows using the functions to save and restore a
-- 		register: >
-- 			:let var_a = getreg('a', 1, 1)
-- 			:let var_amode = getregtype('a')
-- 			    ....
-- 			:call setreg('a', var_a, var_amode)
-- <		Note: you may not reliably restore register value
-- 		without using the third argument to |getreg()| as without it
-- 		newlines are represented as newlines AND Nul bytes are
-- 		represented as newlines as well, see |NL-used-for-Nul|.
--
-- 		You can also change the type of a register by appending
-- 		nothing: >
-- 			:call setreg('a', '', 'al')
function vim.fn.setreg(n, v, opt) end
