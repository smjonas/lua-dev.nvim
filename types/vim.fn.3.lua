-- Without {flags} or with {flags} empty: Deletes the file by the
-- 		name {fname}.  This also works when {fname} is a symbolic link.
-- 		A symbolic link itself is deleted, not what it points to.
--
-- 		When {flags} is "d": Deletes the directory by the name
-- 		{fname}.  This fails when directory {fname} is not empty.
--
-- 		When {flags} is "rf": Deletes the directory by the name
-- 		{fname} and everything in it, recursively.  BE CAREFUL!
-- 		Note: on MS-Windows it is not possible to delete a directory
-- 		that is being used.
--
-- 		The result is a Number, which is 0 if the delete operation was
-- 		successful and -1 when the deletion failed or partly failed.

-- Round off {expr} to the nearest integral value and return it
-- 		as a |Float|.  If {expr} lies halfway between two integral
-- 		values, then use the larger one (away from zero).
-- 		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			echo round(0.456)
-- <			0.0  >
-- 			echo round(4.5)
-- <			5.0 >
-- 			echo round(-4.5)

-- Perform glob() on all directories in {path} and concatenate
-- 		the results.  Example: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "syntax/c.vim")
-- <
-- 		{path} is a comma-separated list of directory names.  Each
-- 		directory name is prepended to {expr} and expanded like with
-- 		|glob()|.  A path separator is inserted when needed.
-- 		To add a comma inside a directory name escape it with a
-- 		backslash.  Note that on MS-Windows a directory may have a
-- 		trailing backslash, remove it if you put a comma after it.
-- 		If the expansion fails for one of the directories, there is no
-- 		error message.
--
-- 		Unless the optional {nosuf} argument is given and is |TRUE|,
-- 		the 'suffixes' and 'wildignore' options apply: Names matching
-- 		one of the patterns in 'wildignore' will be skipped and
-- 		'suffixes' affect the ordering of matches.
--
-- 		When {list} is present and it is |TRUE| the result is a List
-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is, you
-- 		also get filenames containing newlines correctly. Otherwise
-- 		the result is a String and when there are several matches,
-- 		they are separated by <NL> characters.  Example: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "syntax/c.vim", 0, 1)
-- <
-- 		{allinks} is used as with |glob()|.
--
-- 		The "**" item can be used to search in a directory tree.
-- 		For example, to find all "README.txt" files in the directories
-- 		in 'runtimepath' and below: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "**/README.txt")
-- <		Upwards search and limiting the depth of "**" is not
-- 		supported, thus using 'path' will not always work properly.

-- Cleanup unused |Lists| and |Dictionaries| that have circular
-- 		references.
--
-- 		There is hardly ever a need to invoke this function, as it is
-- 		automatically done when Vim runs out of memory or is waiting
-- 		for the user to press a key after 'updatetime'.  Items without
-- 		circular references are always freed when they become unused.
-- 		This is useful if you have deleted a very big |List| and/or
-- 		|Dictionary| with circular references in a script that runs
-- 		for a long time.
--
-- 		When the optional {atexit} argument is one, garbage
-- 		collection will also be done when exiting Vim, if it wasn't
-- 		done before.  This is useful when checking for memory leaks.

-- 		Returns 0 if the current window is not in diff mode.
--- @return number

-- <		Non-ASCII characters are always treated as UTF-8 characters.
-- 		{utf8} is ignored, it exists only for backwards-compatibility.

-- When {dict} is omitted or zero: Return the rhs of mapping
-- 		{name} in mode {mode}.  The returned String has special
-- 		characters translated like in the output of the ":map" command
-- 		listing.
--
-- 		When there is no mapping for {name}, an empty String is
-- 		returned.  When the mapping for {name} is empty, then "<Nop>"
-- 		is returned.
--
-- 		The {name} can have special key names, like in the ":map"
-- 		command.
--
-- 		{mode} can be one of these strings:
-- 			"n"	Normal
-- 			"v"	Visual (including Select)
-- 			"o"	Operator-pending
-- 			"i"	Insert
-- 			"c"	Cmd-line
-- 			"s"	Select
-- 			"x"	Visual
-- 			"l"	langmap |language-mapping|
-- 			"t"	Terminal
-- 			""	Normal, Visual and Operator-pending
-- 		When {mode} is omitted, the modes for "" are used.
--
-- 		When {abbr} is there and it is |TRUE| use abbreviations
-- 		instead of mappings.
--
-- 		When {dict} is there and it is |TRUE| return a dictionary
-- 		containing all the information of the mapping with the
-- 		following items:
-- 		  "lhs"	     The {lhs} of the mapping.
-- 		  "rhs"	     The {rhs} of the mapping as typed.
-- 		  "silent"   1 for a |:map-silent| mapping, else 0.
-- 		  "noremap"  1 if the {rhs} of the mapping is not remappable.
-- 		  "expr"     1 for an expression mapping (|:map-<expr>|).
-- 		  "buffer"   1 for a buffer local mapping (|:map-local|).
-- 		  "mode"     Modes for which the mapping is defined. In
-- 			     addition to the modes mentioned above, these
-- 			     characters will be used:
-- 			     " "     Normal, Visual and Operator-pending
-- 			     "!"     Insert and Commandline mode
-- 				     (|mapmode-ic|)
-- 		  "sid"	     The script local ID, used for <sid> mappings
-- 			     (|<SID>|).
-- 		  "lnum"     The line number in "sid", zero if unknown.
-- 		  "nowait"   Do not wait for other, longer mappings.
-- 			     (|:map-<nowait>|).
--
-- 		The mappings local to the current buffer are checked first,
-- 		then the global mappings.
-- 		This function can be used to map a key even when it's already

-- Stop the {job}.  This can also be used to signal the job.
--
-- 		When {how} is omitted or is "term" the job will be terminated.
-- 		For Unix SIGTERM is sent.  On MS-Windows the job will be

-- 		This goes to the process group, thus children may also be
-- 		affected.
--
-- 		Effect for Unix:
-- 			"term"	 SIGTERM (default)
-- 			"hup"	 SIGHUP
-- 			"quit"	 SIGQUIT
-- 			"int"	 SIGINT
-- 			"kill"	 SIGKILL (strongest way to stop)
-- 			number	 signal with that number

-- 			"hup"	 CTRL_BREAK
-- 			"quit"	 CTRL_BREAK
-- 			"int"	 CTRL_C
-- 			"kill"	 terminate process forcedly
-- 			Others	 CTRL_BREAK
--
-- 		On Unix the signal is sent to the process group.  This means
-- 		that when the job is "sh -c command" it affects both the shell
-- 		and the command.
--
-- 		The result is a Number: 1 if the operation could be executed,
-- 		0 if "how" is not supported on the system.
-- 		Note that even when the operation was executed, whether the
-- 		job was actually stopped needs to be checked with
-- 		|job_status()|.
--
-- 		If the status of the job is "dead", the signal will not be

--
-- 		Each list item in the returned value is a dictionary with the

-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
-- 		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.
--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the

--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor

--
-- 		Note that for '< and '> changing the line number may result in

-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is,
-- 		you also get filenames containing newlines correctly.
-- 		Otherwise the result is a String and when there are several
-- 		matches, they are separated by <NL> characters.
--
-- 		If the expansion fails, the result is an empty String or List.
--
-- 		You can also use |readdir()| if you need to do complicated
-- 		things, such as limiting the number of matches.
--
-- 		A name for a non-existing file is not included.  A symbolic
-- 		link is only included if it points to an existing file.
-- 		However, when the {alllinks} argument is present and it is
-- 		|TRUE| then all symbolic links are included.
--
-- 		For most systems backticks can be used to get files names from
-- 		any external command.  Example: >
-- 			:let tagfiles = glob("`find . -name tags -print`")
-- 			:let &tags = substitute(tagfiles, "\n", ",", "g")
-- <		The result of the program inside the backticks should be one
-- 		item per line.  Spaces inside an item are allowed.
--
-- 		See |expand()| for expanding special Vim variables.  See
-- 		|system()| for getting the raw output of an external command.
--- @param list any[]
function vim.fn.glob(expr, nosuf, list, alllinks) end

-- Return a list containing the number values which represent
-- 		each character in String {expr}.  Examples: >
-- 			str2list(" ")		returns [32]
-- 			str2list("ABC")		returns [65, 66, 67]
-- <		|list2str()| does the opposite.
--
-- 		When {utf8} is omitted or zero, the current 'encoding' is used.
-- 		With {utf8} set to 1, always treat the String as utf-8
-- 		characters.  With utf-8 composing characters are handled
-- 		properly: >
-- 			str2list("aฬ")		returns [97, 769]
--- @return list
function vim.fn.str2list(expr, utf8) end

-- Stop a timer.  The timer callback will no longer be invoked.
-- 		{timer} is an ID returned by timer_start(), thus it must be a
-- 		Number.  If {timer} does not exist there is no error.
--- @return none
function vim.fn.timer_stop(timer) end

-- The result is the name of a buffer, as it is displayed by the
-- 		":ls" command.
-- +		If {expr} is omitted the current buffer is used.
-- 		If {expr} is a Number, that buffer number's name is given.
-- 		Number zero is the alternate buffer for the current window.
-- 		If {expr} is a String, it is used as a |file-pattern| to match
-- 		with the buffer names.  This is always done like 'magic' is
-- 		set and 'cpoptions' is empty.  When there is more than one
-- 		match an empty string is returned.
-- 		"" or "%" can be used for the current buffer, "#" for the
-- 		alternate buffer.
-- 		A full match is preferred, otherwise a match at the start, end
-- 		or middle of the buffer name is accepted.  If you only want a
-- 		full match then put "^" at the start and "$" at the end of the
-- 		pattern.
-- 		Listed buffers are found first.  If there is a single match
-- 		with a listed buffer, that one is returned.  Next unlisted
-- 		buffers are searched for.
-- 		If the {expr} is a String, but you want to use it as a buffer
-- 		number, force it to be a Number by adding zero to it: >
-- 			:echo bufname("3" + 0)
-- <		If the buffer doesn't exist, or doesn't have a name, an empty
-- 		string is returned. >
-- 	bufname("#")		alternate buffer name
-- 	bufname(3)		name of buffer 3
-- 	bufname("%")		name of current buffer
-- 	bufname("file2")	name of buffer where "file2" matches.
--- @return string
function vim.fn.bufname(expr) end

-- Remove the text property type {name}.  When text properties
-- 		using the type {name} are still in place, they will not have
-- 		an effect and can no longer be removed by name.
--
-- 		{props} can contain a "bufnr" item.  When it is given, delete
-- 		a property type from this buffer instead of from the global
-- 		property types.
--
-- 		When text property type {name} is not found there is no error.
--
-- 		See |text-properties| for information about text properties.
--
-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetPropName()->prop_type_delete()
--- @return none
function vim.fn.prop_type_delete(name, props) end

-- The result is a Number.  If the line {lnum} is in a closed
-- 		fold, the result is the number of the first line in that fold.
-- 		If the line {lnum} is not in a closed fold, -1 is returned.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.foldclosed(lnum) end

-- This function acts much like the |input()| function with but
-- 		two exceptions:
-- 		a) the user's response will be displayed as a sequence of
-- 		asterisks ("*") thereby keeping the entry secret, and
-- 		b) the user's response will not be recorded on the input
-- 		|history| stack.
-- 		The result is a String, which is whatever the user actually
-- 		typed on the command-line in response to the issued prompt.
-- 		NOTE: Command-line completion is not supported.
--- @return string
