-- 		values, then use the larger one (away from zero).
-- 		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			echo round(0.456)
-- <			0.0  >
-- 			echo round(4.5)
-- <			5.0 >
-- 			echo round(-4.5)

-- 		    :call term_setapi(buf, "")

-- Perform glob() on all directories in {path} and concatenate
-- 		the results.  Example: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "syntax/c.vim")
-- <
-- 		{path} is a comma-separated list of directory names.  Each
-- 		directory name is prepended to {expr} and expanded like with
-- 		|glob()|.  A path separator is inserted when needed.
-- 		To add a comma inside a directory name escape it with a
-- 		backslash.  Note that on MS-Windows a directory may have a
-- 		trailing backslash, remove it if you put a comma after it.
-- 		If the expansion fails for one of the directories, there is no
-- 		error message.
--
-- 		Unless the optional {nosuf} argument is given and is |TRUE|,
-- 		the 'suffixes' and 'wildignore' options apply: Names matching
-- 		one of the patterns in 'wildignore' will be skipped and
-- 		'suffixes' affect the ordering of matches.
--
-- 		When {list} is present and it is |TRUE| the result is a List
-- 		with all matching files. The advantage of using a List is, you
-- 		also get filenames containing newlines correctly. Otherwise
-- 		the result is a String and when there are several matches,
-- 		they are separated by <NL> characters.  Example: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "syntax/c.vim", 0, 1)
-- <
-- 		{allinks} is used as with |glob()|.
--
-- 		The "**" item can be used to search in a directory tree.
-- 		For example, to find all "README.txt" files in the directories
-- 		in 'runtimepath' and below: >
-- 			:echo globpath(&rtp, "**/README.txt")
-- <		Upwards search and limiting the depth of "**" is not

-- Cleanup unused |Lists| and |Dictionaries| that have circular
-- 		references.
--
-- 		There is hardly ever a need to invoke this function, as it is

-- 		  "rhs"	     The {rhs} of the mapping as typed.
-- 		  "silent"   1 for a |:map-silent| mapping, else 0.
-- 		  "noremap"  1 if the {rhs} of the mapping is not remappable.
-- 		  "expr"     1 for an expression mapping (|:map-<expr>|).
-- 		  "buffer"   1 for a buffer local mapping (|:map-local|).
-- 		  "mode"     Modes for which the mapping is defined. In
-- 			     addition to the modes mentioned above, these
-- 			     characters will be used:
-- 			     " "     Normal, Visual and Operator-pending
-- 			     "!"     Insert and Commandline mode
-- 				     (|mapmode-ic|)
-- 		  "sid"	     The script local ID, used for <sid> mappings

-- 		"lnum" and "col" are the position in the buffer.  The first
-- 		column is 1.  Use a zero "lnum" to delete a mark.  If "col" is
-- 		smaller than 1 then 1 is used.
--
-- 		The "off" number is only used when 'virtualedit' is set. Then
-- 		it is the offset in screen columns from the start of the
-- 		character.  E.g., a position within a <Tab> or after the last
-- 		character.
--
-- 		The "curswant" number is only used when setting the cursor
-- 		position.  It sets the preferred column for when moving the

-- 		preferred column is not set.  When it is present and setting a
-- 		mark position it is not used.
--
-- 		Note that for '< and '> changing the line number may result in

-- Return {text} as a String where any character in {mask} is
-- 		removed from the beginning and  end of {text}.
-- 		If {mask} is not given, {mask} is all characters up to 0x20,
-- 		which includes Tab, space, NL and CR, plus the non-breaking
-- 		space character 0xa0.
-- 		This code deals with multibyte characters properly.
--
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			echo trim("   some text ")
-- <		returns "some text" >
-- 			echo trim("  \r\t\t\r RESERVE \t\n\x0B\xA0") . "_TAIL"
-- <		returns "RESERVE_TAIL" >
-- 			echo trim("rm<Xrm<>X>rrm", "rm<>")
-- <		returns "Xrm<>X" (characters in the middle are not removed)
--- @return string
function vim.fn.trim(text, mask) end

-- with name {name}.  When the highlight group doesn't exist,
-- 		zero is returned.
-- 		This can be used to retrieve information about the highlight
-- 		group.  For example, to get the background color of the
-- 		"Comment" group: >
-- 	:echo synIDattr(synIDtrans(hlID("Comment")), "bg")
--- @return number
function vim.fn.hlID(name) end

-- Return a |Partial| that is null. Only useful for testing.
--- @return funcref

-- Return the largest integral value less than or equal to
-- 		{expr} as a |Float| (round down).
-- 		{expr} must evaluate to a |Float| or a |Number|.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			echo floor(1.856)
-- <			1.0  >
-- 			echo floor(-5.456)
-- <			-6.0  >
-- 			echo floor(4.0)
-- <			4.0
--- @return float
function vim.fn.floor(expr) end

-- Set prompt callback for buffer {buf} to {expr}.  When {expr}
-- 		is an empty string the callback is removed.  This has only
-- 		effect if {buf} has 'buftype' set to "prompt".
--
-- 		The callback is invoked when pressing Enter.  The current
-- 		buffer will always be the prompt buffer.  A new line for a
-- 		prompt is added before invoking the callback, thus the prompt
-- 		for which the callback was invoked will be in the last but one
-- 		line.
-- 		If the callback wants to add text to the buffer, it must
-- 		insert it above the last line, since that is where the current
-- 		prompt is.  This can also be done asynchronously.
-- 		The callback is invoked with one argument, which is the text
-- 		that was entered at the prompt.  This can be an empty string
-- 		if the user only typed Enter.
-- 		Example: >
-- 		   call prompt_setcallback(bufnr(''), function('s:TextEntered'))
-- 		   func s:TextEntered(text)
-- 		     if a:text == 'exit' || a:text == 'quit'
-- 		       stopinsert
-- 		       close
-- 		     else
-- 		       call append(line('$') - 1, 'Entered: "' . a:text . '"')
-- 		       " Reset 'modified' to allow the buffer to be closed.
-- 		       set nomodified
-- 		     endif
-- 		   endfunc
--- @return none
function vim.fn.prompt_setcallback(buf, expr) end

-- Like |gettabwinvar()| for the current tabpage.
-- 		Examples: >
-- 			:let list_is_on = getwinvar(2, '&list')
-- 			:echo "myvar = " . getwinvar(1, 'myvar')
function vim.fn.getwinvar(nr, varname, def) end
