-- 		When {msg} is omitted an error in the form "Expected
-- 		{expected} but got {actual}" is produced.
-- 		Example: >
-- 	assert_equal('foo', 'bar')

-- 			32	mouse double click
-- 			64	mouse triple click
-- 			96	mouse quadruple click (== 32 + 64)
-- 			128	command (Macintosh only)
-- 		Only the modifiers that have not been included in the

-- 		without a modifier.
--- @return number
function vim.fn.getcharmod() end

-- When {expr} is a |List| then this returns the index of the
-- 		first item where {pat} matches.  Each item is used as a
-- 		String, |Lists| and |Dictionaries| are used as echoed.
--
-- 		Otherwise, {expr} is used as a String.  The result is a
-- 		Number, which gives the index (byte offset) in {expr} where
-- 		{pat} matches.
--
-- 		A match at the first character or |List| item returns zero.
-- 		If there is no match -1 is returned.
--
-- 		For getting submatches see |matchlist()|.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing")	" results in 4
-- 			:echo match([1, 'x'], '\a')	" results in 1
-- <		See |string-match| for how {pat} is used.
-- 								*strpbrk()*
-- 		Vim doesn't have a strpbrk() function.  But you can do: >
-- 			:let sepidx = match(line, '[.,;: \t]')
-- <								*strcasestr()*
-- 		Vim doesn't have a strcasestr() function.  But you can add
-- 		"\c" to the pattern to ignore case: >
-- 			:let idx = match(haystack, '\cneedle')
-- <
-- 		If {start} is given, the search starts from byte index
-- 		{start} in a String or item {start} in a |List|.
-- 		The result, however, is still the index counted from the
-- 		first character/item.  Example: >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 2)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "ing", 4)
-- <		result is again "4". >
-- 			:echo match("testing", "t", 2)
-- <		result is "3".
-- 		For a String, if {start} > 0 then it is like the string starts
-- 		{start} bytes later, thus "^" will match at {start}.  Except
-- 		when {count} is given, then it's like matches before the
-- 		{start} byte are ignored (this is a bit complicated to keep it
-- 		backwards compatible).
-- 		For a String, if {start} < 0, it will be set to 0.  For a list
-- 		the index is counted from the end.
-- 		If {start} is out of range ({start} > strlen({expr}) for a
-- 		String or {start} > len({expr}) for a |List|) -1 is returned.
--
-- 		When {count} is given use the {count}'th match.  When a match
-- 		is found in a String the search for the next one starts one
-- 		character further.  Thus this example results in 1: >
-- 			echo match("testing", "..", 0, 2)
-- <		In a |List| the search continues in the next item.
-- 		Note that when {count} is added the way {start} works changes,
-- 		see above.
--
-- 		See |pattern| for the patterns that are accepted.
-- 		The 'ignorecase' option is used to set the ignore-caseness of
-- 		the pattern.  'smartcase' is NOT used.  The matching is always
-- 		done like 'magic' is set and 'cpoptions' is empty.

-- The result is a String, which is a copy of {expr}, in which
-- 		the first match of {pat} is replaced with {sub}.
-- 		When {flags} is "g", all matches of {pat} in {expr} are
-- 		replaced.  Otherwise {flags} should be "".
--
-- 		This works like the ":substitute" command (without any flags).
-- 		But the matching with {pat} is always done like the 'magic'
-- 		option is set and 'cpoptions' is empty (to make scripts
-- 		portable).  'ignorecase' is still relevant, use |/\c| or |/\C|
-- 		if you want to ignore or match case and ignore 'ignorecase'.
-- 		'smartcase' is not used.  See |string-match| for how {pat} is
-- 		used.
--
-- 		A "~" in {sub} is not replaced with the previous {sub}.
-- 		Note that some codes in {sub} have a special meaning
-- 		|sub-replace-special|.  For example, to replace something with
-- 		"\n" (two characters), use "\\\\n" or '\\n'.
--
-- 		When {pat} does not match in {expr}, {expr} is returned
-- 		unmodified.
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 			:let &path = substitute(&path, ",\\=[^,]*$", "", "")
-- <		This removes the last component of the 'path' option. >
-- 			:echo substitute("testing", ".*", "\\U\\0", "")
-- <		results in "TESTING".
--
-- 		When {sub} starts with "\=", the remainder is interpreted as
-- 		an expression. See |sub-replace-expression|.  Example: >
-- 			:echo substitute(s, '%\(\x\x\)',
-- 			   \ '\=nr2char("0x" . submatch(1))', 'g')
--
-- <		When {sub} is a Funcref that function is called, with one

-- Characters in {string} are queued for processing as if they

-- 		characters come after them.  Use the 'i' flag to insert before
-- 		other characters, they will be executed next, before any
-- 		characters from a mapping.
--
-- 		The function does not wait for processing of keys contained in
-- 		{string}.
--
-- 		To include special keys into {string}, use double-quotes
-- 		and "\..." notation |expr-quote|. For example,
-- 		feedkeys("\<CR>") simulates pressing of the <Enter> key. But
-- 		feedkeys('\<CR>') pushes 5 characters.
-- 		The |<Ignore>| keycode may be used to exit the
-- 		wait-for-character without doing anything.
--
-- 		{mode} is a String, which can contain these character flags:
-- 		'm'	Remap keys. This is default.  If {mode} is absent,
-- 			keys are remapped.
-- 		'n'	Do not remap keys.
-- 		't'	Handle keys as if typed; otherwise they are handled as
-- 			if coming from a mapping.  This matters for undo,
-- 			opening folds, etc.
-- 		'i'	Insert the string instead of appending (see above).
-- 		'x'	Execute commands until typeahead is empty.  This is
-- 			similar to using ":normal!".  You can call feedkeys()
-- 			several times without 'x' and then one time with 'x'
-- 			(possibly with an empty {string}) to execute all the
-- 			typeahead.  Note that when Vim ends in Insert mode it
-- 			will behave as if <Esc> is typed, to avoid getting
-- 			stuck, waiting for a character to be typed before the
-- 			script continues.
-- 			Note that if you manage to call feedkeys() while
-- 			executing commands, thus calling it recursively, the
-- 			all typehead will be consumed by the last call.
-- 		'!'	When used with 'x' will not end Insert mode. Can be
-- 			used in a test when a timer is set to exit Insert mode
-- 			a little later.  Useful for testing CursorHoldI.

-- 		window-local option, but it doesn't work for a global variable
-- 		or buffer-local variable.
-- 		When the tab, window or variable doesn't exist {def} or an
-- 		empty string is returned, there is no error message.

-- 		buffer is used.
-- 		Returns a unique ID that can be passed to |listener_remove()|.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked with five arguments:
-- 		    a:bufnr	the buffer that was changed
-- 		    a:start	first changed line number
-- 		    a:end	first line number below the change
-- 		    a:added	number of lines added, negative if lines were
-- 				deleted
-- 		    a:changes	a List of items with details about the changes
--
-- 		Example: >
-- 	    func Listener(bufnr, start, end, added, changes)
-- 	      echo 'lines ' .. a:start .. ' until ' .. a:end .. ' changed'
-- 	    endfunc
-- 	    call listener_add('Listener', bufnr)
--
-- <		The List cannot be changed.  Each item in a:changes is a
-- 		dictionary with these entries:
-- 		    lnum	the first line number of the change
-- 		    end		the first line below the change
-- 		    added	number of lines added; negative if lines were
-- 				deleted
-- 		    col		first column in "lnum" that was affected by
-- 				the change; one if unknown or the whole line
-- 				was affected; this is a byte index, first
-- 				character has a value of one.
-- 		When lines are inserted the values are:
-- 		    lnum	line above which the new line is added
-- 		    end		equal to "lnum"
-- 		    added	number of lines inserted
-- 		    col		1
-- 		When lines are deleted the values are:
-- 		    lnum	the first deleted line
-- 		    end		the line below the first deleted line, before
-- 				the deletion was done
-- 		    added	negative, number of lines deleted
-- 		    col		1
-- 		When lines are changed:
-- 		    lnum	the first changed line
-- 		    end		the line below the last changed line
-- 		    added	0
-- 		    col		first column with a change or 1
--
-- 		The entries are in the order the changes were made, thus the
-- 		most recent change is at the end.  The line numbers are valid
-- 		when the callback is invoked, but later changes may make them
-- 		invalid, thus keeping a copy for later might not work.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked just before the screen is updated,
-- 		when |listener_flush()| is called or when a change is being
-- 		made that changes the line count in a way it causes a line
-- 		number in the list of changes to become invalid.
--
-- 		The {callback} is invoked with the text locked, see
-- 		|textlock|.  If you do need to make changes to the buffer, use
-- 		a timer to do this later |timer_start()|.
--
-- 		The {callback} is not invoked when the buffer is first loaded.
-- 		Use the |BufReadPost| autocmd event to handle the initial text
-- 		of a buffer.
-- 		The {callback} is also not invoked when the buffer is
-- 		unloaded, use the |BufUnload| autocmd event for that.
--

-- 		shell commands, e.g.: >
-- 		    :echo system("cat - &", "foo"))
-- <		which is equivalent to: >
-- 		    $ echo foo | bash -c 'cat - &'
-- <		The pipes are disconnected (unless overridden by shell
-- 		redirection syntax) before input can reach it. Use
-- 		|jobstart()| instead.
--
-- 		Note: Use |shellescape()| or |::S| with |expand()| or
-- 		|fnamemodify()| to escape special characters in a command
-- 		argument.  Newlines in {cmd} may cause the command to fail.
-- 		The characters in 'shellquote' and 'shellxquote' may also
-- 		cause trouble.
--
-- 		Result is a String.  Example: >
-- 		    :let files = system("ls " .  shellescape(expand('%:h')))
-- 		    :let files = system('ls ' . expand('%:h:S'))
--
-- <		To make the result more system-independent, the shell output
-- 		is filtered to replace <CR> with <NL> for Macintosh, and
-- 		<CR><NL> with <NL> for DOS-like systems.
-- 		To avoid the string being truncated at a NUL, all NUL
-- 		characters are replaced with SOH (0x01).
--
-- 		The command executed is constructed using several options when
-- 		{cmd} is a string: 'shell' 'shellcmdflag' {cmd}
--
-- 		The resulting error code can be found in |v:shell_error|.
-- 		This function will fail in |restricted-mode|.
--
-- 		Note that any wrong value in the options mentioned above may
-- 		make the function fail.  It has also been reported to fail
-- 		when using a security agent application.
-- 		Unlike ":!cmd" there is no automatic check for changed files.
-- 		Use |:checktime| to force a check.

-- Simplify the file name as much as possible without changing
-- 		the meaning.  Shortcuts (on MS-Windows) or symbolic links (on
-- 		Unix) are not resolved.  If the first path component in
-- 		{filename} designates the current directory, this will be
-- 		valid for the result as well.  A trailing path separator is
-- 		not removed either.
-- 		Example: >
-- 			simplify("./dir/.././/file/") == "./file/"
-- <		Note: The combination "dir/.." is only removed if "dir" is
-- 		a searchable directory or does not exist.  On Unix, it is also
-- 		removed when "dir" is a symbolic link within the same
-- 		directory.  In order to resolve all the involved symbolic
-- 		links before simplifying the path name, use |resolve()|.

-- Return a List with all text properties in line {lnum}.
--
-- 		When {props} contains a "bufnr" item, use this buffer instead
-- 		of the current buffer.
--
-- 		The properties are ordered by starting column and priority.
-- 		Each property is a Dict with these entries:
-- 		   col		starting column
-- 		   length	length in bytes, one more if line break is
-- 				included
-- 		   id		property ID
-- 		   type		name of the property type, omitted if
-- 				the type was deleted
-- 		   start	when TRUE property starts in this line
-- 		   end		when TRUE property ends in this line
--
-- 		When "start" is zero the property started in a previous line,
-- 		the current one is a continuation.
-- 		When "end" is zero the property continues in the next line.
-- 		The line break after this line is included.
--
-- 		See |text-properties| for information about text properties.

-- 		Can also be used as a |method|: >
-- 			GetLnum()->prop_list()

-- Find directory {name} in {path}.  Supports both downwards and
-- 		upwards recursive directory searches.  See |file-searching|
-- 		for the syntax of {path}.
-- 		Returns the path of the first found match.  When the found
-- 		directory is below the current directory a relative path is
-- 		returned.  Otherwise a full path is returned.
-- 		If {path} is omitted or empty then 'path' is used.
-- 		If the optional {count} is given, find {count}'s occurrence of
-- 		{name} in {path} instead of the first one.
-- 		When {count} is negative return all the matches in a |List|.
-- 		This is quite similar to the ex-command |:find|.
